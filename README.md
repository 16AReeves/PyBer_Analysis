## Analysis of PyBer Rides based on Area Type
---
### Background
---
#### The background of this analysis was to look at different city types and determine which city had the most fares and drivers among Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. This analysis was undertaken to give the leadership at PyBer the data behind what areas may need more drivers, and better fares to increase profits and improve accessibility for underserved areas. This analysis was a deep dive into ride, driver, and fare data.

### Results
---
#### Here is the data for the rider count per city type:

##### Looking at the above two charts, Urban cities have the highest percentage of rides overall with rural cites having the lease amount of rides.

##### Looking at the above two charts, urban cities have the most drivers with rural having the lease amount of drivers. What's interesting in the data however, is how wide spread the amount of drivers are in urban cities. Over the course of the year, the number of drivers in urban cities widely varied compared to the other two city types.

#### Here is the data for the fare price based on city type:

##### Looking at the above two charts, the median fare price was highest in rural areas with the lowest fare price being in the urban cities. The overall percentage of fares was highest in the urban areas with the rural areas have the lowest percentage of total fares.

#### Here is the summary chart of the ride data per city, where the circles correlate with total drivers per city type:

##### Looking at the above chart, rural cities have the highest fare rates due to lower number of drivers. Urban cities have lower fare prices, due to the high volume of drivers per city. 
---
#### Here is the overall summary data of the fare rates among the different city types:

##### Looking at the above chart, the months from Jan to May 2019 had a varying range of prices among the three city types. Late Feburary seems to have the highest total fare for all three types. Urban has the highest total, due to more rides and drivers. While rural cities have a lower total, due to less riders and drivers. 
---
#### Here is the overall summary chart of the above data:

##### The above chart shows the summary of all the above data visualizations. Rural cities tend to have fewer drivers, with higher fare rates as a result. Suburban cities have the best average, the drivers and fare rates are nearly steady and even. Urban cities tend to have the most drivers, resulting in lower average fare rates. 
---
### Summary
---
#### The first suggestion to the CEO would be to decrease the number of drivers in urban cities overall. From the data, fares trend higher when the total number of drivers is less. This would even out the number of drivers, since the data trends with there being so many drivers that fares are smaller on average. The second suggestion would be to add more drivers to the rural areas, even if in only a small increase. This would help cover the demand of riders, as the above data shows the number of riders exceeds the number of drivers in rural cities. Adding more drivers to rural areas would increase driver avaliablity, possibly resulting in more riders and more average fare prices. The third suggestion would be to add more drivers to the suburban areas, which could promote higher fare prices per ride. Adding more drivers to the suburban areas could bridge the gap between the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver.
